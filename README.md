# E-Shop.com-Group
For this project, you will use the ecommerce data tables on the SQL server. The project itself is open format, with
the only direction being as follows:

###  "I am the Director of this ECommerce site. How are we performing?"

Your task is to clean and perform analysis on this data to create a report detailing the ecommerce site performance
and opportunities for our firm. You will need to include charts and graphs as necessary to support your proposal. For
this, the project you must use SQL, Python, and Tableau/PowerBI/Excel. However, that is not to discourage you
from using any other resources to present a suitable, polished report/presentation deck/dashboard.


There is no explicit minimum, nor maximum, length to the report/presentation deck/dashboard. Simply keep in mind
that you must present enough context to the data to make your proposal clear while remembering that there are other
proposals that I will be reading, so the report must also be concise. You will be more intimately familiar with the
data, your task is to highlight the connections in the data that are relevant to our firm.


You, and your team, will present a 5-7 minute presentation, including a presentation deck. You will also submit all
SQL queries, Python scripts, and Tableau/PowerBI/Excel files created in the process of performing your analysis.
This is the opportunity to show off your hard work and your ability to connect information into meaningful and
operational insights.


Finally, each team member (if you’re in a team) must grade the other team members, including what each team
member was responsible for and what they produced. Be honest about the quantity and quality of the work
performed by each member and the grade (I’ll know from your presentations if you aren’t honest here). This will be
submitted to me independently by each member.
